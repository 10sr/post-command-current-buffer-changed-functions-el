Hook run when current buffer changed


== What is This?

This is a Emacs Lisp package that provides a hook variable
`switch-buffer-functions`.

This hook will be run when the current buffer has been changed after each
interactive command, i.e. when `post-command-hook` is called.

When functions are hooked, they will be called with the previous buffer and
the current buffer.  For example, if you eval:

[source,elisp]
----
(add-hook 'switch-buffer-functions
          (lambda (prev cur) (message "%S -> %S" prev cur)))
----

then the message like `"#<buffer \*Messages\*> -> #<buffer init.el<.emacs.d>>"`
will be displayed to the echo area each time when you switch the current
buffer.
